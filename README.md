## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Utility-first CSS
- Custom shadows and responsive design

### What I learned

I improved my understanding of:

- Positioning background images using Tailwind
- Using fixed and translate utilities for layout decoration
- Applying custom box shadows with `rgba()`

Hereâ€™s the custom box shadow I used:

```css
.card {
  box-shadow: 0px 50px 100px -20px rgba(8, 70, 94, 0.5);
}
````

### Continued development

I'd like to:

- Explore adding animations when the card loads
- Improve accessibility with `aria` labels and better color contrast

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - The official docs helped me apply responsive utilities and background image techniques effectively.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - My go-to reference for understanding CSS `box-shadow` and `positioning`.
